A Cookiecutter template for creating Snakemake-based pipelines with a Python CLI using Click.

## Features

- Self-contained, installable Python package
- Separates snakemake pipeline from run directory for easier re-use
- CLI with `init-config` (Jinja2 prompt) and `run` commands
- Pass-through to full Snakemake CLI

- Minimal working rule as example - you need to write the real pipeline
- Includes folders for rules, envs, configs
